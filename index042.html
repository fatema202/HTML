         <h1>1. Lalbagh Fort:</h1><p>The 
        17th-century Mughal fort, which stands by the Buriganga River, is one of the oldest 
        architectural structures in Bangladesh. It was built by the then Mughal Subahdar 
        Muhammad Azam Shah, son of Emperor Aurangzeb. It is believed that the construction 
        of the fort was never completed.The fort consists of 3 frameworks – (i) ‘Diwan-I-Aam’,
        which was the residence of the Governor, (ii) a mosque and (iii) the tomb of Bibi Pari,
         who was the daughter of Emperor Saista Khan. Interestingly, there are some mysteries 
         around this fort. There are tunnels underneath the fort which lead to the other side of 
         the river. During the Sepoy Revolution of 1857, many soldiers tried to flee through those 
         tunnels and died. Few British soldiers who followed them did not return. To investigate
          the situation, the researchers sent an elephant and a dog to those tunnels, but they 
          didn’t return either. Soon after that horrific incident, the path was sealed.</p>

         <h1>2. Ahsan Manzil:</h1><p>Initially, it was a vacation house for a Zamindar of Jamalpur 
            district, Sheikh Enayet Ullah. After his death, his son sold this property to the French
             traders in 1740. They dug a pond in front of the building where fresh water could be
              fetched. After having a great business in the subcontinent for almost a century,
               they surrendered under the full British power and sold all their properties. So,
                in 1830, Khwaja Alimullah – an established man in Dhaka bought the property. He
                 added a mosque in this compound. After his death, his son Khwaja Abdul Gani took
                  a progressive look at the property and named it “Ahsan Manzil” after his son Ahsan
                   Ullah.  1985, the Dhaka National Museum obtained this property and made it a museum 
                   after a long restoration process.The Palace is divided into 2 sides. ‘Rangmahal’ 
                   is on the eastern side. It was the entertainment spot where foreign and local girls
                    danced and sang for the principal owner, Enayet Ullah. The ballroom was also there
                     at this time. The Western side has a living room, dining room, library, card room 
                     and guest rooms. The Building is front-faced by the mighty Buriganga River.
                     The architecture and the decoration epitomize the Mughal taste perfectly.</p>

         <h1>3. Star Mosque:</h1><p>This mosque is based in Armanitola, Dhaka. A very antique mosque built by Mirza 
            Golam Pir in the 19th century. Built in Mughal style, initially, it was a simple rectangular mosque.
            The roof was crowned by 3 domes and covered with star-shaped china clay tiles. These tiles are also 
            seen on the exterior. Later, in the 20th century, a local businessman named Ali Jahan Bepari 
            renovated the mosque. He started by adding a veranda. He repaired the tiles with mosaic. 
            It was a popular decoration at that time. Along with the domes, the exterior and the interior
             are done with star-shaped tiles. That is why the mosque is called Star mosque. In 1987, the
              Ministry of Religious Affairs of Bangladesh added a new prayer hall, eventually leading to 
              2 additional domes in the mosque.</p>

         <h1>4. Mainamati:</h1><p>It is the extinct Buddhist religious site in the district of Comilla. 
            It serves a beautiful colonial cemetery as Comilla Cantonment is nearby. The Mainamati Cemetery
             is a historical memorial with about thousands of graves from the Second World War. Mainamati was
              the name of a Chandra Queen, the mother of Govindachandra, who was a ruler of the Chandra dynasty. Between the 10th and 11th centuries, they ruled the Samatata division of Bengal. Currently, this is the part of Comilla, 114 km away from the capital, Dhaka. They used this place to perform their religious activities. </p>
